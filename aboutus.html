        <p>1445. That’s a long time ago. Belgium was still part of the Netherlands and the Netherlands still had plenty of colonies. And as true tourists the Dutch often brought wonderful and odd things over from their excursions abroad. So it came to pass that exotic spices became readily available in our parts. All to the benefit of our beloved monks.<br><br> The Original Belgian Wheat Beer. Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. <br><br> Historical sources tell us that the first wheat beer was incredibly sour. That is until the Bluesteel monks started experimenting with orange peel and coriander from the colony Curaçao: a divine discovery that led to the world famous Bluesteel recipe.</p>
